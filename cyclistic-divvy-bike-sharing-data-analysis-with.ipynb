Divvy provides residents and visitors with a convenient, fun and affordable transportation option for getting around and exploring Chicago.\n\nDivvy, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially-designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the region. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system. People use bike share to explore Chicago, commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements, and more.\n\nDivvy is available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year, and riders have access to all bikes and stations across the system.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data sources used\n\n<a href = \"https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html\" target = \"https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html\">Divvy Data (July2021 to June2022)</a> - The data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system; and any trips\nthat were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Business Task\n\n\n1.

If I was a part of Divvy team, I would have found out the treshold when the company stops counting as a regular ride.\n\nAs we can calculate, every ride that is close to 12 hours in a row is worth of annual subscription. The only type of customer that could be close to that amount of time is a casual rider with a daily pass. But from the pricing plans on the website, we know that it shouldn't be 12 consecutive hours riding the same bike.

It took time to find missing station names that would be helpful in a geotargeting ad campaign for casual users. I won't put here the whole dataset for 2021 and 2022 combined.\n\nWe had to check current pricing plans on the company's website to see what can be offered to casual riders to turn them into members. The patterns of bike use for different groups are shown on the plots, so we had to segment users for our analysis.\n\nStarting with the Day Pass users. If they ride once a month on a day off or some tourists have a short trip to Chicago, they might not sign up for the whole year, but may do it for a month. It allows them to roam around the city easily if they decide to have one more trip during the month.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary\n* Casual riders spent more time in bikes\n* Popular spot is Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St\n* Classic bikes are most rented\n* Docked bikes spent most time cycling\n* Saturday has highest count of rented bikes\n* Member riders love classic and electric bikes but casual riders prefer docked bikes\n* Member riders have been in consistent usage for all days, same for casual riders\n* Member riders spent less time biking than casual riders.","metadata":{}}]}
